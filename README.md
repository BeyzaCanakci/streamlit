# Streamlit Data Analysis Projects

This repository contains interactive data analysis projects built with Streamlit. All applications are organized as separate Python files inside the pages directory and are loaded through the main entry point streamlit_app.py.

## Features

- Interactive dashboards using Streamlit  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) tools  
- Visualizations with Python libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)  
- User-friendly interface for exploring and understanding data  
- Modular project structure: each analysis as a separate script under pages/

## Folder Structure

```
streamlit/
â”œâ”€â”€ streamlit_app.py         # Main entry point for the Streamlit app
â”œâ”€â”€ pages/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 1ðŸ“ŠExploratory_Data_Analysis.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 2Microbial_Analysis.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ 3Disease_Prediction_with_Model.py
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md

```

- Run streamlit_app.py to launch the Streamlit interface.
- Each file in the pages/ directory represents a different data analysis project.
